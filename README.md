## Detailed Description

Pizza Parlor
This is an application for ordering a pizza where a user can choose from individual toppings and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.  It uses Object Oriented Javascript to collect data and place into and object.  It uses a prototype to create the sum of the key values of the object to calculate a price.  This is an early project for a student software engineer.  "Ciao Allora" is an Northern Italian slang term for "hello! well?".  It is used as a casual greeting in cities such a Milan.
